Question B

(i)Deflate (DEFLATE) compression algorithm would be the best
Deflate provides a good balance between compression ratio and performance,
making it suitable for compressing text-based messages or small-to-medium-sized data.

(ii)The overall worst-case time complexity of the message handling process,
assuming compression and decompression are the most time-consuming parts,
can be summarized as follows:

compression: 𝑂(𝑚log⁡𝑘) where 𝑚 is the length of the original message and 𝑘 is the number of unique symbols in the original message. 
Message distribution: 𝑂(𝑛) where 𝑛 is the number of connected clients. Decompression: 𝑂(𝑚′log⁡𝑘′) where 𝑚′m′ is the length of the compressed message and 𝑘′
is the number of unique symbols in the compressed message.
So, the overall worst-case time complexity would be the sum of these complexities:
𝑂(𝑚log⁡𝑘)+𝑂(𝑛)+𝑂(𝑚′log⁡𝑘′)
